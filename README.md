## Description üìñ

##### Openlib is an open-source app to download and read books from shadow library ([Anna‚Äôs Archive](https://annas-archive.org)). The app has a built-in reader to read books.

##### As [Anna‚Äôs Archive](https://annas-archive.org) doesn't have an API, the app works by sending requests to Anna‚Äôs Archive and parsing the response to objects. The app extracts the mirrors from response and downloads the book.
