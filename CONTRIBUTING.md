# Openlib contribution guidelines

## Getting started

- Flutter powers this project. Make sure you have the latest version of Flutter.

- If you want to fix a bug or implement a new feature already mentioned in
  the [issues](https://github.com/dstark5/Openlib/issues), please assign this issue to you and/or comment about it.

- Whether you have to implement a new feature, please, open an issue or discussion regarding it to ensure it will be
  accepted.

## Open a pull request

When you're done making changes, and you would like to propose them for review, open your PR (pull request). You can use
the
GitHub user interface for some small changes, like fixing a typo or updating a readme. You can also fork the repo and
then clone it locally, to view changes and run your tests on your machine.

## Submit your PR & get it reviewed

- Once you submit your PR, others from the Docs community will review it with you. The first thing you're going to want
  to do is a [self-review](#self-review).
- After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit
  them to your branch.

## Self-review

You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:

- [ ] Confirm the changes doesn't break anything else.
- [ ] Compare your pull request's source changes to staging to confirm that the output matches the source and that
  everything is rendered as expected. This helps spot issues like typos, content that doesn't follow the style guide,
  or content that isn't rendered due to versioning problems.
- [ ] Review the content for technical accuracy.
- [ ] Copy-edit the changes for grammar or spelling mistakes.

## Notes

- Please don't modify readme and other information files (except for typos).
- Avoid adding new dependencies unless required. APK size is important.
